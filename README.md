# Graph similarity demo

This demo showcases several algorithms to compute similarity between labeled
graphs. The explanation is contained in the `demo_graph_similarities.ipynb`
notebook. I advice install the dependencies via `virtualenv`:

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can visualize and execute the notebook launching `jupyter-notebook`
and selecting `demo_graph_similarities.ipynb`.
